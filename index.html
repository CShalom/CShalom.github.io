      <h1>Welcome to my first website!</h1>
        
        <h2>A quick summary and presentation</h2>

          <p>Howdy everyone!<br>
        I am Shalom and I started my full-stack development journey last year. I have already learned so much throughout the past 12 months and even to build this simple website, there were a lot of things I did not know how to do before actually wanting to do them... <br>
        It is so exiting to see how much I have accomplished in the past 3 weeks or so it took me to put this site together and I know I have got so much more to learn. <br>
        Nevertheless, I really hope that the skills I have showcased here will convince, seduce and attract and that it will open the doors for me to land that dream job as a Junior Developer.<br>
        Please have a walk through at <b> My first website</b> by clicking on the hyperlinks in the top right corner. <br>
        Enjoy!<br></p>
